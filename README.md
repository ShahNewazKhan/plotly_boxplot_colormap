# plotly_boxplot_colormap
I was recently asked by my boss to apply a color scale to a series of Plotly Box plots I was working on for a Dash application. The notion was to plot multiple box plots on the same graph and have each box plot be darker or lighter based on itâ€™s distance from the overall median in the dataset.

The issue here is that Plotly only supports color scales for heatmaps, scatter plots & contour plots. I go over the the solution I applied to this problem in this [Medium blog post](http://shahnewazkhan.ca/portfolio/custom-color-scale-for-plotly-boxplots/), enjoy!

## Env setup
```sh
# Create virutalenv
virtualenv venv -p python3
# Activate virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required modules
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Render the coloscaled Plotly Boxplot
```
python colorize.py
```
